					<h3>MESSAGE FROM THE HONORABLE VICE CHANCELLOR </h3>
					<p>
						Moot court is an activity that strives to provide young, aspiring attorneys with a taste of what the world of advocacy has in store for them. It teaches participants not only how to construct solid arguments based on significant research, but also how to deliver them in the most creative and confident way possible. It enables law students to comprehend the complexities of diverse sectors of law and the approaches to deal with them in greater depth. Competition law is one such field whose development is closely linked to that of the country. 
						The discipline of competition law, which involves the study of competitive dynamics in the market, has assumed paramount importance in the dynamic economy of India, and has become an area teeming with new and exciting potential. The frontiers of competition law increase with each step the world takes toward globalisation. In order for India to become a leader in the post-COVID world, the next generation of Indian lawyers must possess all of the skills necessary to flourish in a field as important as competition law. Moot courts, arguably the greatest conceivable way for students to learn the workings of antitrust law and other subjects of law, have been made a core part of National Law University, Jodhpur's pedagogy in pursuit of this precise purpose. 
						In terms of moot court competitions, the annual Antitrust Law Moot Court Competition is one of the most significant achievements of National Law University, Jodhpur in this sector, in addition to its excellent record of results in leading national and international moots. The Antitrust Moot, now in its thirteenth year, provides an excellent platform for students from law schools all over the country to understand the workings of law inside a courtroom by enabling them to argue before antitrust lawyers and academicians, including judges from India's two most powerful competition authorities, the Competition Commission of India and Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas. The NLU Antitrust Moot Court Competition has earned a reputation as one of the country's most prominent moot court competitions throughout the years. The Antitrust Moot Court Competition stands out every year in terms of the experience it delivers to its competitors. Even the coronavirus pandemic couldn't stop the Antitrust Moot Court Competition from continuing its march forward, with this year's edition being held fully online. The key to the Antitrust Moot Court Competition's success is the organisers' solemn dedication in providing the conducive environment for the nurturing the future legal brains, as well as their never-ending quest to push the boundaries of human knowledge in the field of law. 
						I applaud the National Law University, Jodhpur's entire team for successfully organising the Thirteenth NLU Antitrust Law Moot Court Competition this year. The students, instructors, and staff participating in the competition's organisation did not let the ongoing pandemic dampen their spirits, which is a source of great pride for the entire National Law Universities community. Rather, in true budding lawyer flair, the organisers devised inventive ways to ensure that even the constraints of an online event would not stifle the Competition's growth and that the Antitrust Moot, 2022 emerged as the best version of itself. I wish the competing teams the best of luck and hope that what they've learned during this competition will help them succeed in the future.

One of its mandates is to partake in efforts with various stake holders to promote competition advocacy, create public awareness and 3 impart training on issues pertaining to competition law. As a part of its competition law advocacy initiatives, it has associated itself with National Law University, Jodhpur in the organization of the NLU Antitrust Law Moot Court Competition.
