					      	<p>The activity of moot courts is a unique exercise, one which aims to give young, budding lawyers a brief yet momentous experience of what the world of advocacy holds for them. It seeks to teach its participants not only how to build strong cases through deep and extensive research, but also how to present them in the most creative and persuasive manner. It allows law students to understand, in-depth, the nuances of various fields of law and the law’s ways of addressing them. One such field, the growth of which is inextricably intertwined with the growth of the country, is the field of competition law.
							In the ever-growing and ever-evolving economy of technological-era India, the field of competition law, which involves the study of competition forces in the market, has assumed utmost importance and become an area teeming with new and exciting opportunities. With every stride that the world takes towards globalisation, the horizons of competition law expand. For India to become a leader in the new, post-COVID world, it is imperative that the upcoming crop of Indian lawyers be equipped with every skill that is required for one to excel in a field as significant and important as competition law. It is in pursuance of this very goal that National Law University, Jodhpur has made moot courts, arguably the best possible way to allow students to understand the workings of antitrust law and other equally important fields of law, a cardinal ingredient of its pedagogy. 
							Speaking of moot court competitions, one of the most significant contributions of National Law University, Jodhpur in this field, in addition to its stellar record of performances in leading national and international moots, is its flagship annual Antitrust Law Moot Court Competition. </p>

					      	<p>Running into its twelfth year, the Antitrust Moot provides an excellent platform to students from law schools all across the country to understand law as it works inside a courtroom by giving them an opportunity to argue before the doyens of antitrust lawyers and academicians, including judges from the two biggest authorities in the field of competition law in India – the Competition Commission of India and Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas. Over the years, the NLU Antitrust Moot Court Competition has cultivated a reputation of being one of the most prestigious moot court competitions in the country. Every year, the Antitrust Moot Court Competition stands out in terms of the experience that it provides to its participants. Even the coronavirus pandemic could not stop the Antitrust Moot Court Competition from marching ahead, with this year’s edition being organised entirely on a virtual platform. The secret to the Antitrust Moot Court Competition’s success is a simple one, and lies in the organisers’ solemn commitment to provide the best environment for the incubation of future legal minds and their endless pursuit to push the limits of human knowledge in the field of law. 
							I congratulate the entire team of National Law University, Jodhpur in their endeavour to organise the Twelfth NLU Antitrust Law Moot Court Competition, 2021. It is a matter of immense pride to the entire National Law Universities’ fraternity that the students, faculty, and staff involved in the organisation of the Competition did not allow the ongoing pandemic to douse their spirits. Rather, in a fashion befitting budding lawyers, the organisers worked out creative ways to make sure that even the restrictions of an online event did not stymie the growth of the Competition and that the Antitrust Moot, 2021 came out as the best version of itself. I wish the participating teams all the best and hope that everything they have learnt in the course of this Competition contributes to their success in the future.</p>
